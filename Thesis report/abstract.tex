To \textit{summarize} my thesis:\\

Stereo vision is a method of extracting 3D information of a scene using images taken from different viewpoints. There are many approaches for disparity map (DM) creation in a Stereo vision system. Embedded GPUs are low power GPUs embedded in the same chip along with the host CPU. Stereo vision is one of the suitable applications to be implemented in an embedded GPU. In this master thesis, the effect of parameter variations in a Stereo vision algorithm is studied. Software implementation of the algorithm is done and several optimizations are done to improve the execution time of the algorithm. Optimizations yielded 31X to 35X improvement in execution time depending on the platform implemented. The algorithm is then implemented on Nema eGPU, from ThinkSilicon Ltd. and its functional performance and execution times are studied. Comments are given on the eGPU architecture based on observations recorded. Future works are suggested along the field.\\
